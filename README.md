# TW_Mailer_basic
Write a socket-based client-server application in C/C++ to send and receive messages like an internal mail-server.  The client connects to the server and communicates through a stream socket connection in a proprietary plain-text format delimited by new-line or “dot + new-line” (see detail-description).
